            <p>I am so glad that you have stumbled upon my website! I'll do my best to keep this site as up to date as possible, but if you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me!</p>
            <h3 class="question">Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I'm Rohan Purandare, a second year CS Master's student at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. I also recently graduated from Purdue this past May with a Bachelor's degree in CS with concentrations in Software Engineering, Machine Intelligence, Security, Algorithmic Foundations, and Databases and Information Systems, and certificates in Applications of Data Science and Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I am really fascinated by all things CS and love integrating what I learn into projects.</p>
            <h3 class="question">What do I do outside of class?</h3>
            One of my favorite things about Purdue is the myriad of organizations that it has. There is really something for everyone! As a graduate student, I am a part of Purdue Chaiyya, but as an undergrad, I was a part of three different organizations: BoilerMake, the Undergraduate Student Board for Computer Science (USB), and LaunchPad.<br /><br />
            <div class="textImg">
                <p>I was the Director of BoilerMake XI, an organization that hosts Purdue's largest hackathon. Lasting 36 hours, we give about 500 students the opportunity to work on projects, network with sponsors and other hackers, and have a fun break from school.</p>
                <img src="assets/bm.JPG" alt="BoilerMake" style="width:22vw; min-width:300px; border-radius: 0; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">
            </div>
            <div class="textImg">
                <p>USB is an organization that works to improve the CS department at Purdue through a number of initiatives. Formerly the Vice-President of USB, I have now shifted my focus towards leading the Humans of Purdue CS initiative, an initiative that hopes to emulate <a href="https://www.humansofnewyork.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;">HoNY</a>. In addition to that, I am also a member of the International Student Panel, an initiative geared towards helping international students with job prospects, and CS193, an initiative geared towards freshmen in CS/DS/AI to help them learn some of the fundamentals of CS.</p>
                <img src="assets/usb_group_2022.webp" alt="BoilerMake" style="width:22vw; min-width:300px; border-radius: 0; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">
            </div>
            <div class="textImg">
                <p>LaunchPad is an organization that pairs freshmen - mentees - in a CS-related major with upperclassmen - mentors - in similar majors to work on creating a project of the mentee's choosing. Within LaunchPad, I am currently the Web Dev lead where I lead a group of 4 other LaunchPad organizers to create and maintain our website.</p>
                <img src="assets/lp.jpg" alt="LaunchPad" style="width:22vw; min-width:300px; border-radius: 0; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">
            </div>
            <br /><br />
            Outside of these organizations, I am also involved in TA-ing. I have currently TA-ed CS 38100 (The Introduction of the Analysis of Algorithms) and TA-ed and taught CS 19300 (Tools). I find it to be extremely rewarding and fun as I am able to give back to the CS community while helping students find their "aha!" moment.
            <h3 class="question">What do I do in my free time?</h3>
            I love trying new restaurants around the West Lafayette area and playing volleyball with my friends. I am also a massive soccer fan, both in terms of playing and watching (COME ON ARSENAL!!), and I really like music. I have also recently grown fond of drawing as I find it to be a fun and creative way to unwind.

                <h3 class="employer">Trumid - Technology Intern</h3>
                <p class="jobInfo"><i>Remote • June 2024 - August 2024</i></p>
                <p>Over the course of my internship at Trumid, I was able to work on a whole host of things and gain valuable 
                    exposure about the financial technology industry. At Trumid, I worked on the Observability team which was 
                    an amazing experience as I was able to learn about what a lot of the different teams at Trumid do. Though 
                    only 11 weeks, I was able to work on 6 projects that included creating alerts for the company's different 
                    services and developing applications and tools to help with the uniformity and consistency of the company's 
                    member information. Using tools like Prometheus and Grafana, I was able to increase the observability for 
                    the Prometheus Operator, a key tool that ensures that we can ingest data from our different services. 
                    Additionally, I created an alerting tool that notified the appropriate engineers when their services had a 
                    significant lag in consuming Kafka records, eliminating any instances of lag that lasted more than 5 minutes. 
                    I was also able to develop a static analysis tool that identified any commits that changed any existing 
                    metrics or dashboards, which in turn made it easier for the rest of the observability team to provide 
                    feedback to engineers. In addition to this, I ensured that ownership information for the different services 
                    that we provided was uniform across the entire repository, adding tests in CI/CD to notify engineers if their 
                    changes broke the uniformity. With the structure that I created to accomplish this, I was able to further 
                    create a CLI tool to provide engineers with information about other engineers and groups. With this, I was 
                    also able to create a Slack application that consistently synchronized users that they would be in the correct 
                    groups and channels. Using the OpsGenie API, I was also able to make sure that the on call engineers for each 
                    teams were added to their team's support handle. This application eliminated any sort of ambiguity in regards 
                    of how to communicate with different people and groups, ensuring a seamless communication. Overall, I am 
                    extremely fortunate to say that I interned at Trumid as I was able to work with some amazing people, learn a
                     lot, not just about the financial technology scene, but also about various software engineering tools, and 
                     make an impact in the company.</p>

                <p class="jobInfo"><i>Bellevue, WA • May 2023 - July 2023</i></p>
                <p>Similar to last year with the AppStream team, I continued to work on the same project where I was improving 
                    the Dataplane Logs Page in the Photon Ops Console website, a website used by on-calls to audit and troubleshoot 
                    customer issues. In addition to retrieving logs, I added authentication to retrieve logs from appropriate 
                    accounts and also improved the UI to make it more intuitive to use for the user. Additionally, I created 
                    a new page for the Photon Ops Console, the Instance Event Timeline Page. This page parses through all of 
                    the logs of an AppStream streaming instance and analyzes the log message to determine whether or not it is 
                    a notable event. From there it retrieves all the notable event logs and concisely displays them on this page 
                    to create a summary of the Instance timeline.</p>

                    The current data retrieval process for the Photon Ops Console was working inefficiently as it only stored 
                    3 days worth of data and incurred relatively high costs. I was tasked to create a pipeline that would retrieve 
                    data relating to the different streaming instances as well as data logs directly from the data base. I did this 
                    by querying the search parameters from the user in the database, filtering the data to remove irrelevant 
                    information, and then reformatting and returning the data so that it would be displayed properly.</p>

                <p>Over the course of a ten-week long period, I interned with the PTC's Creo team. Over here, I specifically 
                    worked with their collaboration service team, who are responsible for allowing users to collaborate on 
                    the same 3D modeling document in Creo. My job was to automate the API Specification as it was previously 
                    written by hand. I incorporated a third-party tool called go-swagger and modified the code and wrote an 
                    external program to allow go-swagger to parse through the code and generate an API Spec. From here, I 
                    utilized another third-party tool called swagger2openapi to convert the API Spec from Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 
                    3.0.0</p>

                <p>For CS 38100 (Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms) and CS 19300 (Tools) I graded homeworks, proctored exams, held office hours as well as conducted Practice/Study/Observation (PSO) sessions.

                <p>I taught students (approximately 700 students), the basics of git, terminal, and various programming techniques to help them create a strong foundation for programming in their later years at Purdue.

                <p>I was able to teach them the fundamentals 
                    and was able to help them create projects like connect-four and various ciphers. With math, I either help them with
                    their homework or I teach them material that is related to the content they learn at school. Since I am able to 
                    tutor these kids one-on-one, I create a lesson plan that is geared to each of their capabilities and needs. This has
                    been an incredibly rewarding experience as I have been able to witness first-hand how much more confidence these kids 
                    have gained in computer science and math. I also really value every interaction I have with my students because I 
                    learn how to become a better teacher.</p>
