            <p>I am so glad that you have stumbled upon my website! I'll do my best to keep this site as up to date as possible, but if you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me!</p>
            <h3 class="question">Who am I?</h3>
            <p>I'm Rohan Purandare, a senior at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. At Purdue, I am working towards getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with focuses in Software Engineering, Machine Intelligence, Security, Algorithmic Foundations, and Databases and Information Systems, and certificates in Applications of Data Science and Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I am really fascinated by all things CS and love integrating what I learn which is why I will be staying a fifth year at Purdue to complete my Master's degree through their 4+1 program.</p>
            <h3 class="question">What do I do outside of class?</h3>
            One of my favorite things about Purdue is the myriad of organizations that it has. There is really something for everyone! I am personally a part of three different organizations: BoilerMake, the Undergraduate Student Board for Computer Science (USB), and LaunchPad. <br /><br />
            I am currently the Director of BoilerMake, an organization that hosts Purdue's largest hackathon. Lasting 36 hours, we give about 500 students the opportunity to work on projects, network with sponsors and other hackers, and have a fun break from school. <br /><br />
            USB is an organization that works to improve the CS department at Purdue through their number of initiatives. Formerly the Vice-President of USB, I have now shifted my focus towards leading the Humans of Purdue CS initiative, an initiative that hopes to emulate <a href="https://www.humansofnewyork.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;">HoNY</a>. In addition to that, I am also a member of the International Student Panel, an initiative geared towards helping international students with job prospects, and CS193, an initiative geared towards freshmen in CS/DS/AI to help them learn the some of the fundamentals of CS.<br /><br />
            LaunchPad is an organization that pairs freshmen, mentees, in a CS related major with upperclassmen, mentors, in similar majors to work on creating a project of the mentee's choosing. Within LaunchPad, I am currently the Web Dev lead where I lead a group of 4 other LaunchPad organizers to create and maintain our website. <br /><br />
            Outside of these organizations, I am also involved in TA-ing. I have currently TA-ed CS 38100 (The Introduction of the Analysis of Algorithms) and TA-ed and taught CS 19300 (Tools). I find it to be extremely rewarding and fun as I am able to give back to the CS community while helping students find their "aha!" moment.
            <h3 class="question">What do I do in my free time?</h3>
            I love trying new restaurants around the West Lafayette area and playing volleyball with my friends. I am also a massive soccer fan, both in terms of playing and watching (COME ON ARSENAL!!), and I really like music. I have also recently grown fond of drawing as I find it to be a fun and creative way to unwind.

                <p>Over the course of 12 weeks, I worked on an AWS Product called AppStream, specifically on their Photon Ops Console, a web-based tool that is used by on-calls to audit and troubleshoot different issues that arise. The current data retrieval process for the Photon Ops Console was working inefficiently as it only stored 3 days worth of data and incurred relatively high costs. I was tasked to create a pipeline that would retrieve data relating to the different streaming instances as well as data logs directly from the data base. I did this by querying the search parameters from the user in the database, filtering the data to remove irrelevant information, and then reformatting and returning the data so that it would be displayed properly.</p>

Over here, I specifically worked with their collaboration service team, who are responsible for allowing users to collaborate on the same 3D modeling document in Creo. My job was to automate the API Specification as it was previously written by hand. I incorporated a third-party tool called go-swagger and modified the code and wrote an external program to allow go-swagger to parse through the code and generate an API Spec. From here, I utilized another third-party tool called swagger2openapi to convert the API Spec from Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0.0</p>
